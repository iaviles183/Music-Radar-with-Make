Automation built with Make.com that connects Spotify to a Telegram bot to notify users about new artist releases.
Easy to configure, with step-by-step documentation so anyone can set it up using their own Spotify app and bot.

Users can add as many artists as they want, but keep in mind that adding too many may exhaust the free monthly credits provided by Make.com.
There are 1000 free credits. I run about 7 artists and the credit consumtption is usually 16 - 17 depending if there is actually a new release from an artist.
Basically that is 16 credits x 30 days = 480 credits best case scenario.

I'm adding the blueprint so you can download it and also a guide to do it everything from scratch.

# MANUAL AUTOMATION

If you want to manually do everything from scratch and learn a bit how make.com works, you can do it by simply following the PDF guides and configure everything as it says.
