Automation built with Make.com that connects Spotify to a Telegram bot to notify users about new artist releases.
Easy to configure, with step-by-step documentation so anyone can set it up using their own Spotify app and bot.
Users can add as many artists as they want, but keep in mind that adding too many may exhaust the free monthly credits provided by Make.com.
There are 1000 free credits. I run about 7 artists and the credit consumtption is usually 16 - 17 depending if there is actually a new release from an anrtist.
